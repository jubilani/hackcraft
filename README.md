# hackcraft
This is my first attempt at a Minecraft mod for Hack Club's Hackcraft YSWS event. It has a new item (End Fragment) that you can currently get in Creative Mode. It is also stackable up to 72 items. The next version of this mod will make this item mineable in the End and hopefully craft things with it.
